/**
 * Searches the specified array `xs` for the specified value `x` using the binary search algorithm. The array must be
 * sorted into ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements prior to making this call. If it is
 * not sorted, the results are undefined.
 *
 * @param xs The array to be searched.
 * @param x The value to be searched for.
 * @param [n = xs.length] The maximum index in `xs` that is searched (exclusive).
 * @param comparator The callback that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are compared using
 *     comparison operators.
 * @returns The index of the searched value, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, `-insertionPoint - 1`. The
 *     insertion point is defined as the point at which the searched value would be inserted into the array: the index
 *     of the first element greater than the searched value, or array length if all elements in the array are less than
 *     the specified key. Note that this guarantees that the return value will be â‰¥ 0 if and only if the searched value
 *     is found.
