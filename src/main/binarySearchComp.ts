/**
 * Searches the specified array `xs` for the specified value `x` using the binary search algorithm. The array must be
 * sorted into ascending order according to the `comparator` prior to making this call. If it is not sorted, the results
 * are undefined.
 *
 * @param xs The array to be searched.
 * @param x The value to be searched for.
 * @param comparator The callback that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are compared using
 * [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators).
 * @param n The maximum index in `xs` that is searched (exclusive).
 * @returns The index of the searched value, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, -(insertion point) - 1. The
 * insertion point is defined as the point at which the searched value would be inserted into the array: the index of
 * the first element greater than the searched value, or array length if all elements in the array are less than the
 * specified key. Note that this guarantees that the return value will be â‰¥ 0 if and only if the searched value is
 * found.
