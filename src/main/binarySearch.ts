/**
 * Searches the specified array {@link xs} for the specified value {@link x} using the binary search algorithm.
 * The array must be sorted into ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements prior to making
 * this call. If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.
 *
 * @param xs The array to be searched.
 * @param x The value to be searched for.
 * @param n The maximum index in {@link xs} that is searched (exclusive).
 * @returns The index of the searched value, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, -(insertion point) - 1. The
 * insertion point is defined as the point at which the searched value would be inserted into the array: the index of
 * the first element greater than the searched value, or array length if all elements in the array are less than the
 * specified key. Note that this guarantees that the return value will be â‰¥ 0 if and only if the searched value is
 * found.
